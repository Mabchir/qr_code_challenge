## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- how to import a font to the css file and that it's important to import all the needed styles if using google fonts

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700&display=swap");
```

- sometimes the code is overwritten and there is a need to add

```css
!important;
```

after the desired value.

### Continued development

It would be helpful to understand the reason why some added values in CSS need "!important" to actually show up.

I want to learn more about :

- bootstrap and it's capabilities
- how to center any element in the screen regardless of the screen/browser/device used

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Doc ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) - This helped me find the different weights that a text could have the corresponding value to each categoty "normal = 400" etc ...

- [CSS Tricks ](https://css-tricks.com/quick-css-trick-how-to-center-an-object-exactly-in-the-center/) - This helped me center the card element.
